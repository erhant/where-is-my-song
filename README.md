# where-is-my-song
When you know you have added the song somewhere in your playlist, but not sure how to find it.

The code is written extemely hastily (over a time of 1 day at most) so there are lots of refactors and considerations to go over.

## TODOs
- Regex check for song url
- Better styling
- Multiple redundant requests are made at the start?
- Add a song to a playlist if wanted
